# Grievance-Redressal-System
Good afternoon.  
Myself, Md. Habibuzzaman. 
We have created a web application 'Grievance Redressal System' for our University using Django framework. The Grievance Redressal System is basically another
term for 'Complaint Management System'. In this increasing number of students, it is very difficult to manage all the complaints manually.
Therefore, the system is developed to manage all the complaints in a systematic way through online. The main objective of this 
web application is to provide a platform for the students and faculties to register their grievances to the concerned authorities.
The system has four end users:
1. Student
2. Faculty
3. Handling Authority and
4. Processing Authority

Now, you might be thinking how actually this system works. So, let me explain the workflow of this system with a brief demonstration. 


First of all, the student and faculties will register their complaints through online. Then, the handling authority will raise the complaints
to the processing authority. The processing authority will then process the complaints and take necessary actions. After that, the processing
authority will update the status of the complaints. Moreover, the student and faculties will be able to view the status of their complaints
through online.
