# Grievance-Redressal-System

We have created a web application, 'Grievance Redressal System', for our university, 'East West University', using Django framework. The 'Grievance Redressal System' is basically another term for 'Complaint Management System'. In this increasing number of students, it is very difficult to manage all the complaints manually. Therefore, the system is developed to manage all the complaints in a systematic way through online. The main objective of this web application is to provide a platform for the students and faculties to register their grievances to the concerned authorities.
The system has four end users:
1. Student
2. Faculty
3. Handling Authority and
4. Processing Authority
